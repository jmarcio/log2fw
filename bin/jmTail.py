#  Description :
#     Equivalent to Unix "tail -f" tool, but able to follow multiple files
#     at the same time.
#
#     Adapted from the answer by Blake VandeMerwe. See :
#         https://gist.github.com/amitsaha/5990310
#     Modifications include tailing multiple files simultaneously and some
#     python code updates
#
#  History :
#     20/09/2023 - Initial release
